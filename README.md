# CO2-sensor
After reading an article about the health issues caused by high CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentrations, the price af a ready-made sensor trigger me to start this DIY 
project. After some research I decided on using the following components for 
this project:
- An `SCD40` CO<sub>2</sub> sensor.
- An `ESP32-C3 SuperMini` microcontroller.
- A 3D-printed enclosure.

I ordered the `SCD40` and the `ESP32-C3 SuperMini` via AliExpress and am 
currently waiting for the delivery. Based on previous experience I'll use 
[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) to design the enclosure once I've got 
the breadboard version operational.
