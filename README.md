# CO2-sensor
After reading an article about the health issues caused by high CO<sub>2</sub> 
concentrations, the price af a ready-made sensor trigger me to start this DIY 
project. After some research I decided on using the following components for 
this project:
- An [`SCD40`](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=scd40) CO<sub>2</sub> sensor.
- An [`ESP32-C3 SuperMini`](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=esp32-c3+supermini) microcontroller.
- [`Tasmota firmware`](https://tasmota.github.io/) to operate the microcontroller.
- A 3D-printed enclosure, to be designed with [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

I ordered the `SCD40` and the `ESP32-C3 SuperMini` via AliExpress and I'm 
currently waiting for the delivery. I'll start on the design of the enclosure
once I've got the breadboard version of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor operational.

*To be continued ...*
